Based on years of teaching experience, this textbook builds from simple fundamental concepts to cover the essentials of the field. Aimed at physics undergraduate students with a basic background in quantum mechanics, it guides readers through theory and experiment, introducing all the central concepts without getting caught up in details. Worked examples and exercises make this useful as a self-study text for those who want a brief introduction before starting on more advanced books.

  abstract = {The ability to manipulate individual atoms, ions or photons allows controlled engineering of the quantum state of small sets of trapped particles; this is necessary to encode and process information at the quantum level. Recent achievements in this direction have used either trapped ions1,2,3 or trapped photons in cavity quantum-electrodynamical systems3,4. A third possibility that has been studied theoretically5,6 is to use trapped neutral atoms. Such schemes would benefit greatly from the ability to trap and address individual atoms with high spatial resolution. Here we demonstrate a method for loading and detecting individual atoms in an optical dipole trap of submicrometre size. Because of the extremely small trapping volume, only one atom can be loaded at a time, so that the statistics of the number of atoms in the trap, N, are strongly sub-poissonian (ΔN2 ≈ 0.5N). We present a simple model for describing the observed behaviour, and we discuss the possibilities for trapping and addressing several atoms in separate traps, for applications in quantum information processing.},

  abstract = {Arrays of atoms can be a useful resource for quantum information. However, loading atoms into arrays is typically a stochastic process, which leads to imperfections. Two groups have now performed defect-free assembly of atoms into arrays (see the Perspective by Regal). The researchers first loaded the atoms stochastically and imaged the system. They then shuttled the atoms around to form perfect arrays. Barredo et al. worked with two-dimensional arrays, creating a variety of spatial configurations. Endres et al. manipulated atoms along a line. By further cooling down the atoms and generating interactions among them, the techniques may also find use in quantum simulation.Science, this issue p. 972, p. 1021; see also p. 1024Large arrays of individually controlled atoms trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, deterministic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparation of fully loaded two-dimensional arrays of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single atom and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid atom moves depending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the arrays. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral atoms in tunable two-dimensional geometries.},

  abstract = {Predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its primary sequence of amino acids is known as the protein folding problem. Due to the central role of proteins’ structures in chemistry, biology and medicine applications, this subject has been intensively studied for over half a century. Although classical algorithms provide practical solutions for the sampling of the conformation space of small proteins, they cannot tackle the intrinsic NP-hard complexity of the problem, even when reduced to the simplest Hydrophobic-Polar model. On the other hand, while fault-tolerant quantum computers are beyond reach for state-of-the-art quantum technologies, there is evidence that quantum algorithms can be successfully used in noisy state-of-the-art quantum computers to accelerate energy optimization in frustrated systems. In this work, we present a model Hamiltonian with $${\mathcal{O}}({N}^{4})$$scaling and a corresponding quantum variational algorithm for the folding of a polymer chain with N monomers on a lattice. The model reflects many physico-chemical properties of the protein, reducing the gap between coarse-grained representations and mere lattice models. In addition, we use a robust and versatile optimization scheme, bringing together variational quantum algorithms specifically adapted to classical cost functions and evolutionary strategies to simulate the folding of the 10 amino acid Angiotensin on 22 qubits. The same method is also successfully applied to the study of the folding of a 7 amino acid neuropeptide using 9 qubits on an IBM 20-qubit quantum computer. Bringing together recent advances in building gate-based quantum computers with noise-tolerant hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, this work paves the way towards accessible and relevant scientific experiments on real quantum processors.},

The PSFs are expressed using the Debye integral. Under anL∞ constraint imposing peak matching, optimal and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the PSFs. With anL1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal Gaussian parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found that (1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and nearly perfect for the LSCM. All the Gaussian parameters derived in this study are in explicit analytical form, allowing their direct use in practical applications.},

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2-7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times-our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8-14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry-calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He-H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

  abstract = {A basic requirement for quantum information processing systems is the ability to completely control the state of a single qubit. For qubits based on electron spin, a universal single-qubit gate is realized by a rotation of the spin by any angle about an arbitrary axis. Driven, coherent Rabi oscillations between two spin states can be used to demonstrate control of the rotation angle. Ramsey interference, produced by two coherent spin rotations separated by a variable time delay, demonstrates control over the axis of rotation. Full quantum control of an electron spin in a quantum dot has previously been demonstrated using resonant radio-frequency pulses that require many spin precession periods. However, optical manipulation of the spin allows quantum control on a picosecond or femtosecond timescale, permitting an arbitrary rotation to be completed within one spin precession period. Recent work in optical single-spin control has demonstrated the initialization of a spin state in a quantum dot, as well as the ultrafast manipulation of coherence in a largely unpolarized single-spin state. Here we demonstrate complete coherent control over an initialized electron spin state in a quantum dot using picosecond optical pulses. First we vary the intensity of a single optical pulse to observe over six Rabi oscillations between the two spin states; then we apply two sequential pulses to observe high-contrast Ramsey interference. Such a two-pulse sequence realizes an arbitrary single-qubit gate completed on a picosecond timescale. Along with the spin initialization and final projective measurement of the spin state, these results demonstrate a complete set of all-optical single-qubit operations.},

Quantum processors based on a few quantum bits have been demonstrated before using nuclear magnetic resonance, cold ion traps and optical systems, all of which bear little resemblance to conventional computers. This new processor is based on superconducting quantum circuits fabricated using conventional nanofabrication technology. There is still a long way to go before quantum computers can challenge the classical type. The processor is very basic, containing just two quantum bits, and operates at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. But the chip contains all the essential features of a miniature working quantum computer and may prove scalable to more quantum bits and more complex algorithms.},

Here, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing the two-valence electron structure of individual alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms. We find fidelities for Rydberg state detection, single-atom Rabi operations and two-atom entanglement that surpass previously published values.

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses optical dipole traps for neutral atoms. Methods for storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents a particularly interesting situation, because Bose-Einstein condensation seems attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms. Further, optical dipole traps can be seen as storage devices at the low end of the presently explorable energy scale. Future experiments exploiting the particular advantages of these traps can reveal interesting new phenomena.},

  abstract  = {Universal fault-tolerant quantum computers will require error-free execution of long sequences of quantum gate operations, which is expected to involve millions of physical qubits. Before the full power of such machines will be available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits. In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of near-term quantum devices is discussed. With focus on chemistry applications, a general description of variational algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained. Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple error-mitigation schemes are introduced that could improve the accuracy of determining ground-state energies. Advancing these techniques may lead to near-term demonstrations of useful quantum computation with systems containing several hundred qubits.},

By studying the oscillatory response of a two-level 1S0-1P1 88Sr MOT, we firmly establish the laser cooling dynamics predicted by Doppler theory. Measurements of the MOT temperature, however, deviate severely from Doppler theory predictions, implying significant additional heating mechanisms. To explore the feasibility of attaining quantum degenerate alkaline-earth samples via evaporative cooling, we also present the first experimental demonstration of magnetically trapped metastable 88Sr. Furthermore, motivated by the goal of establishing the fermionic isotope 87Sr as one of the highest-quality, neutral-atom-based optical frequency standards, we present a preliminary study of sub-Doppler cooling in a 87Sr MOT. A dual-isotope (87Sr and 88Sr) MOT is also demonstrated.},

Such systems provide insights into strongly correlated quantum matter2-6, while at the same time enabling new methods for computation7-10 and metrology11. Here we demonstrate a programmable quantum simulator based on deterministically prepared two-dimensional arrays of neutral atoms, featuring strong interactions controlled by coherent atomic excitation into Rydberg states12. Using this approach, we realize a quantum spin model with tunable interactions for system sizes ranging from 64 to 256 qubits. We benchmark the system by characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states and demonstrating quantum critical dynamics consistent with an Ising quantum phase transition in (2 + 1) dimensions13. We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation14, experimentally map the phase diagram and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations. Offering a new lens into the study of complex quantum matter, these observations pave the way for investigations of exotic quantum phases, non-equilibrium entanglement dynamics and hardware-efficient realization of quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers hold promise to enable efficient simulations of the properties of molecules and materials; however, at present they only permit ab initio calculations of a few atoms, due to a limited number of qubits. In order to harness the power of near-term quantum computers for simulations of larger systems, it is desirable to develop hybrid quantum-classical methods where the quantum computation is restricted to a small portion of the system. This is of particular relevance for molecules and solids where an active region requires a higher level of theoretical accuracy than its environment. Here, we present a quantum embedding theory for the calculation of strongly-correlated electronic states of active regions, with the rest of the system described within density functional theory. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach by investigating several defect quantum bits in semiconductors that are of great interest for quantum information technologies. We perform calculations on quantum computers and show that they yield results in agreement with those obtained with exact diagonalization on classical architectures, paving the way to simulations of realistic materials on near-term quantum computers.},
