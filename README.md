# MScProject

My MSc project is about making an array op optical tweezers using a spatial light modulator and high NA microscope objective. Specifically, on how to optimize the arrays when imaging through thick glass of a vacuum viewport. 

The end goal is to use these optical tweezers to trap individual Sr atoms for a hybrid quantum computer.
